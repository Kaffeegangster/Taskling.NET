There are three versions of the TravelInsightsAnalysisService for the different block types.
In the static main method is the code to launch each one.

Follow these steps to get started
1. Execute the "Prepare database" script in the DatabasePreparationScripts folder
2. Make sure just one of the TravelInsightsAnalysisService is uncommented and execute the program. Use the debugger to step through the code so that you see what happens.
3. Execute the "AddSomeMoreJourneys" script to add some more data
4. Run the same TravelInsightsAnalysisService again and see it find the new data and process it.

If you want to wipe all the Taskling data at any point then run the "DeleteAllTaskingData" script.

You can write your own queries to see the data in the taskling tables, though there are some useful queries in the "UsefulTasklingQueries" folder.
